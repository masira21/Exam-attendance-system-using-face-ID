This project mainly emphasizes on the concept of Attendance System where I have allowed the attendance system concept to be applied suring examinations.
I have used python libraries such as dlib,cmake and much more inorder to have a succesful face recognition based exam attendance system.
A brief intro about my project: There are mainly three dashboards where first dashboard is the Student registration dashboard, the main role of this dashboard is to register the student using Face ID and thier basic student details.
The face ID that is registered along with the student details will be used later in the attendance system to mark the attendance of the student.
The second dashboard is the attendance marking dashboard which is used to mark the attendance of the student using the students name, roll, course, Face ID. The attendance of the student will be marked only if the face ID of the student matches in the Student database.
The Third dashboard is for the admin ie:The teachers. The admin is allowed to add,delete or remove exams based on the date,year and course.
There is a SQl database as well which comprises of mainly three collections mainly: Student, Attendance, and Examination.
The first collection is the registeration of the student details, the second collection is the attendance marking collection which will be marked only if the face id matches from the student collection, the third collection examination which is the admin collection which comprises of the exam name,date,course,year and time of the exam.
Languages used: Python(including various libraries for face recognition those are mainly OpenCV, dlib, face_recognition), HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
